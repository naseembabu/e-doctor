# E-Doctor  (Multiple Disease Predictor)
In this project, I trained machine learning models to predict the likelihood of Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. The training was conducted using datasets from Kaggle, utilizing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for the predictive modeling. To develop the graphical user interface (GUI), I employed the Streamlit library and deployed the application on the Streamlit cloud service.

The application's home page presents users with three disease prediction options, each corresponding to one of the targeted diseases. Users can select the disease they are concerned about and input relevant parameters. Based on this input, the system predicts whether the user is at risk of having the chosen disease. This intuitive interface ensures that users can easily navigate and utilize the prediction system to gain insights into their health conditions.
